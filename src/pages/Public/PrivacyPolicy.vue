                <p>This privacy policy was adapted from one created by <a href="https://automattic.com/" class="beta-link" target="_blank">Automattic</a>. They have very kindly created theirs with a Creative Commons Sharealike License. I went through the document and revised it so that it reflects what we believe! Please find the policy below:</p>
                
                <h3 class="beta-title" id="principles">Our Principles</h3>
                <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At BetaMe, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
                    <li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
                    <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private) and permanently deleted.</li>
                    <li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
                    <li>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="whoWeAre">Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
                <p>Hello, I am the creator of BetaMe! My mission is to build a community of writers and readers who engage with each others work and encourage each other to improve.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that is collected when you use my website, betame.io, which will be referred to in this Privacy Policy as "BetaMe".</p>
                <p>Below I explain how the site collects, uses, and shares information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="informationCollected">Information BetaMe Collects</h3>
                <p>BetaMe only collects information about you if there is a reason to do so – for example, to provide the service, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
                <p>There are threes ways it is possible to collect information about you: information you give to the website, automatically through being on the website, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that gets collected.</p>

                <h5 class="beta-title">Information You Provide to BetaMe</h5>
                <p>It’s probably no surprise that the information you put on BetaMe gets saved. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how the information is needed. Here are some examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Basic Account Information:</span> BetaMe asks for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, individuals who sign up for a BetaMe.io account need to provide an email address along with a username – and that’s it. In the future, we may offer you the chance to add more information about yourself but this is currently not possible.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Content Information:</span> You may also provide us with information about yourself in writing posts you upload to BetaMe.io and in the comments you post on BetaMe.io. For example, if you upload a piece of writing that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to you… but it’s not to everyone!</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Communications with Us (Hi There!):</span> You may also provide us information when you send us an email or fill in a survey. When you communicate with us via form, email, comment, or otherwise, we may choose to store a copy of our communications.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="beta-title">Information That Gets Collected Automatically</h5>
                <p>There is also some informations that gets automatically collected:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Log Information:</span> Like most online service providers, BetaMe collects information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Usage Information:</span> BetaMe collects information about your usage of our services. For example, we collect information on the actions that BetaMe users perform – in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [BetaMe.io username] deleted “[title of post]” at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, searches) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Location Information:</span> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="informationUse">How and Why We Use Information</h3>
                <h5 class="beta-title">Purposes for Using Information</h5>
                <p>We use information about you as mentioned above for the purposes listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide our Services – for example, to set up and maintain your account;</li>
                    <li>To further develop and improve our Services – for example, by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help with their writing and beta-reading;</li>
                    <li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our services, which helps us improve our services and make them easier to use;</li>
                    <li>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition;</li>
                    <li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our services, protect the security of our services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of BetaMe and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our services;</li>
                    <li>To communicate with you. For example, we may email you to solicit your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on BetaMe. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (Please keep in mind that even if you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account); and</li>
                    <li>To personalize your experience using our services, provide content recommendations (for example, through reader post suggestions) and send relevant messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have been our user for a certain length of time).</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="beta-title">Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h5>
                <p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account; or</li>
                    <li>The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</li>
                    <li>The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</li>
                    <li>We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our services; to improve our services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our services; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our services; and to personalize your experience; or</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="sharingInformation">Sharing Information</h3>
                <h5 class="beta-title">How We Share Information</h5>
                <p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information.</p>
                <p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</span> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Third Party Vendors:</span> We currently do not use any third party vendors but in the future we may use one if we believe it improves our services. In this case, it may be necessary to share the information with the vendor. We will require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Legal and Regulatory Requirements:</span> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</span> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BetaMe, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">With Your Consent:</span> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may in the future share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your site through our Publicize feature.</li>
                    <li><span class="text-bold">Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</span> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="beta-title">Information Shared Publicly</h5>
                <p>Information that you choose to make public is – you guessed it – disclosed publicly.</p>
                <p>That means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on BetaMe are all available to others – and we hope you get a lot of views!</p>
                <p>Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>
                <p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>

                <h5 class="beta-title">How Long We Keep Information</h5>
                <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it — which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.</p>
                <p>For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to BetaMe.io website, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to BetaMe and investigate issues if something goes wrong.</p>
                <p>As another example, when you delete a writing post from BetaMe.io, it gets deleted immediately and cannot be recovered.</p>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="security">Security</h3>
                <p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="choices">Choices</h3>
                <p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limit the Information that You Provide</li>
                    <li>Close Your Account: While we’d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our services :( :( :( :(, you can close your account by sending an email. We will only continue to retain your information after closing your account if that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="rights">Your Rights</h3>
                <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
                    <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
                    <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
                    <li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
                    <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>
                <p>EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="reachUs">How to Reach Us</h3>
                <p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please contact us via email at lily@beta-me.io.</p>

                <h3 class="beta-title" id="changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, BetaMe may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. BetaMe encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising a change log, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage, or sending you a notification through email). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.</p>
